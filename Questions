Sample Code for Screen shots 
	File scrFile = ((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
			// Now you can do whatever you need to do with it, for example copy somewhere
			FileUtils.copyFile(scrFile, new File("c:\\screenshot.png"));
      
      The TakesScreenshot is an interface the driver is expliicty converted to type TakeScreenshot.
      The getScreenshotAS is a method of TakesScreenshot that convert the screenshot into a image file. 
      The CopyFile method the store the file in the required destination.

 Trail code for Drag and Drop 
 I'm using,
Chrome Driver 2.28
Selenium 3.3.0
Chrome Version  56.0.2924.87 (64-bit)

The drag and drop does not function for me as well, but I have an alternative solution

public static void DragSelect(IWebElement element1, IWebElement element2)
{
    Actions action = new Actions(Context.Instance.Driver);
    action.MoveToElement(element1, 5, 5)
        .ClickAndHold()
        .MoveToElement(element2, 5, 5)
        .Release()
        .Build()
        .Perform();
}

Note that if an offset is not entered in the move to element then it will not work.
